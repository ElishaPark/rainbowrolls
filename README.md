## Background
RainbowRolls is a game that tests how well players can distinguish between colors within color families. Users are presented with a grid of colors, represented as pieces of sushi, and asked to click on the one different color from the choices on the screen. The levels increase in difficulty, with changes in colors becoming more discreet every four levels. The game was built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## Instructions
The game is simple! Click on the piece of sushi that is different in color from the rest before time runs out. Each incorrect guess in any given round reduces the allotted time by 2 seconds.  

## Technologies
All features within this game were implemented using Javascript, CSS, and HTML, and Webpack.
